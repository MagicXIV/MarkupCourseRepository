## Support

We will not use the course page on Blackboard.

Instead, all course materials can be found here on the course website, [www.gerkovink.com/markup](https://www.gerkovink.com/markup).

For handing in assignments, we will use [the course repository on GitHub](https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2023).

Please post your content-related questions as [an issue in the course repository](https://github.com/gerkovink/markup2023/issues).

Questions regarding personal circumstances may be shared through e-mail with the teaching team.
