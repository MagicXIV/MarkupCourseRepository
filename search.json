Students will get to know the professional field of statistical markup and its innovations and challenges. It consists of meetings in which students will learn about markup languages (\\(\\LaTeX\\) and Markdown), learn efficient programming with R Markdown, experience developing Shiny web apps, get to know version control with Git and will create and maintain their own data archive repository and personal (business card) page through GitHub. Combining these lectures, the students get acquainted with different viewpoints on marking up statistical manuscripts, areas of innovation, and challenges that people face when working with, analyzing and reporting (simulated) data. Knowledge obtained from this course will help students face multidimensional problems during their professional career."

It was designed to help with the publishing process by defining the structure and content of documents.\nSGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language): Evolved from GML in the 1980s, SGML became an ISO standard and was used as the basis for several other markup languages, including HTML.\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language): Developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML became the standard markup language for creating web pages. It’s a subset of SGML.\nXML (eXtensible Markup Language): Introduced in the late 1990s, XML was designed to store and transport data. Unlike HTML, which is about displaying information, XML is about carrying information."

    "text": "Technically speaking\n\nTex (aka \\(\\LaTeX\\)) is not a markup language, but a software system for document preparation. This is because plain text is used as opposed to other markup languages. However, markup tagging conventions are used to define and stylize document stucture, graphical elements, citations and text.\nMarkdown is an extremely simplified alternative to document preparation software systems. markdown is a lightweigt markup language that can be edited using any text editor, while being quick and easy to compile. It is nowadays widely considered as the language of the internet as it bridges most great attributes of other markup languages.\nQuarto is even more comprehensive as it is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. quarto is aimed at delivering reproducible, consistent Pandoc markdown documents that unify the best of all other markup languages."

    "text": "Traditional Word Processors vs Scientific Writing\n\n\nGraphical (Word) Processors\n\nWhile Word and similar word processors have built-in equation editors, they often lack the flexibility and customization options that markup languages offer.\nFormatting equations consistently across a large document or multiple documents can be challenging in Word.\nCollaborating on complex scientific documents with multiple authors can lead to formatting inconsistencies, especially when different versions of the software are used.\nIntegration with other Tools is not always straightforward or impossible.\nWord documents, especially those with complex equations, might not always display consistently across different devices or software versions.\n\n\nMarkup languages\n\nMarkup languages (especially \\(\\LaTeX\\)) provide precise control over the layout and appearance of elemants and equations.\nThe same code will produce the same output regardless of the platform or software version, ensuring consistency.\nSimple integration with version control systems, reference managers, and other tools essential for scientific writing.\nMany scientific journals provide \\(\\LaTeX\\) or markdown templates, making it easier for researchers to prepare manuscripts that meet specific formatting requirements."
