    "text": "What is Markup?\nA markup language is a system for annotating a document that provides structure and meaning to the content, allowing it to be processed and displayed in a consistent manner across different platforms and devices.\nExtremely brief history\n\nGML (Generalized Markup Language): Developed in the 1960s by IBM, GML was one of the first markup languages. It was designed to help with the publishing process by defining the structure and content of documents.\nSGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language): Evolved from GML in the 1980s, SGML became an ISO standard and was used as the basis for several other markup languages, including HTML.\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language): Developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML became the standard markup language for creating web pages. It’s a subset of SGML.\nXML (eXtensible Markup Language): Introduced in the late 1990s, XML was designed to store and transport data. Unlike HTML, which is about displaying information, XML is about carrying information."

    "text": "Technically speaking\n\nTex (aka \\(\\LaTeX\\)) is not a markup language, but a software system for document preparation. This is because plain text is used as opposed to other markup languages. However, markup tagging conventions are used to define and stylize document stucture, graphical elements, citations and text.\nMarkdown is an extremely simplified alternative to document preparation software systems. markdown is a lightweigt markup language that can be edited using any text editor, while being quick and easy to compile. It is nowadays widely considered as the language of the internet as it bridges most great attributes of other markup languages.\nQuarto is even more comprehensive as it is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. quarto is aimed at delivering reproducible, consistent Pandoc markdown documents that unify the best of all other markup languages."

From paragraphs to images to links, all are defined using HTML tags.\nEmails: Many emails, especially those with formatting, images, or links, are compose using HTML.\nOnline Platforms: Social media posts, blogs, and even some word processors use HTML behind the scenes to structure and display content.\n\nXML in Everyday Applications:\n\nData Storage: Many applications use XML to store configuration data, user settings, or other information.\nOffice Documents: Formats like Microsoft’s .docx (Word) or .xlsx (Excel) are essentially zipped XML files. When you save a Word document, you’re saving XML data.\nWeb Services: Many web services and APIs return data in XML format, which is then processed and displayed by the application.\nRSS Feeds: Used by news websites and blogs to syndicate content, RSS feeds are XML documents that can be read by various applications."

The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report.

All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."
